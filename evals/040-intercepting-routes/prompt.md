Create a Next.js App Router application with intercepting routes. Implement a photo gallery where clicking on a photo opens it in a modal using intercepting routes. The main page should have a link to "/photo/1" and an intercepting route "(.)/photo/[id]" that shows "Photo 1 Modal" in a div with className="modal". The regular route "/photo/[id]" should show "Photo 1 Page" in a div with className="page".
